<h1>The Best Movies According to Ian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
    As a title suggests, a film about redemption where a man who is falsely
    imprisoned makes the best of a bad situation while plotting to escape.
</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>
    Makes good use of nonlinear story-telling and ties together multiple
    character's stories well. Requires a couple of watches to understand
    the timeline.
</p>
<h3>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</h3>
<p>
    The setting/world that they built paired with memorable performances
    from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio make this easy to watch again
    and again.
